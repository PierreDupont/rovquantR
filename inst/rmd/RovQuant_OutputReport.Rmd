### `r Sys.Date()`

# Introduction

Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) and dead recoveries are a centerpiece of national and regional large carnivore monitoring in Norway and Sweden. The Scandinavian `r species` (*`r latSpecies`*) population is monitored annually using non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) and recovery of dead individuals and both countries have collected an extensive individual-based data set publicly available and stored in the Scandinavian large carnivore database Rovbase ([rovbase.no](https://www.rovbase.no/), [rovbase.se](https://www.rovbase.se/)).

Since 2017, project [RovQuant](https://www.nmbu.no/en/projects/rovquant), from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), has been developing statistical methods to exploit the potential of this database and allow a comprehensive assessment of the population status and dynamics of three large carnivore species, namely the brown bear (*Ursus arctos*), wolf (*Canis lupus*), and wolverine (*Gulo gulo*).

At the core of this analytical framework [@bischof2019rovquant; @bischof2020estimating] are Bayesian spatial capture-recapture (SCR) and open-population spatial capture-recapture (OPSCR) models [@ergon2014separating; @bischof2016; @chandler2018characterizing; @dupont2021deadreco]. These models use the spatial and temporal information contained in the repeated genetic detections of individuals to estimate various population parameters, including spatially explicit abundance and vital rates. In addition, OPSCR models use the temporal information contained in data collected over multiple years to also estimate recruitment and survival probabilities, as well as inter-annual movements. Importantly, the approach accounts for imperfect detection during sampling (i.e., the fact that some individuals are not detected at all) and animal movement (i.e., the fact that individuals may use and be detected in multiple management units or countries). The OPSCR method brings along several advantages, including the ability to map density, derive jurisdiction-specific abundance, estimate survival and recruitment (which are needed for making population projections), and yield tractable measures of uncertainty [@bischof2019rovquant; @bischof2020estimating].

RovQuant reported abundance estimates for wolverines and wolves on an annual basis since 2019 [@bischof2019wolf; @bischof2019rovquant; @bischof2020estimating; @flagstad2021; @milleret2021wolf; @milleret2021wolverine; @milleret2022wolf; @milleret2022wolverine; @milleret2023wolf; @milleret2023wolverine; @milleret2024wolf] and for brown bears in Norway since 2022 [@dupontNorBear2021; @dupontNorBear2022]. During these and other analyses [@milleret2018pab; @milleret2019local; @bischof2020consequences; @dupont2021deadreco; @turek2021efficient; @dey2022; @moqanaki2021], RovQuant has continuously improved the performance of the OPSCR models.

The present report summarizes the analysis of a `r length(years)`-year time-series (`r years[1]`- `r years[length(years)]`) of the `r engSpecies` monitoring data available in Rovbase as of `r extractDate` using the latest version of the OPSCR model.

This analysis provides the following information:

-   Annual and sex-specific estimates of the number of `r engSpeciess` within the main population range (with credible intervals), as well as estimates by county and large carnivore management region.

-   Annual maps of `r engSpecies` density throughout the speciesâ€™ primary range in Scandinavia.

-   Annual estimates of survival, cause-specific mortality, recruitment, and population growth rate (with credible intervals).

-   Estimated proportion of individuals detected through non-invasive genetic sampling (with credible intervals).

  colnames(numDet_sexYear) <- c(years,"Total")
  numDet_sexYear <- rbind(numDet_sexYear,colSums(numDet_sexYear))
  rownames(numDet_sexYear) <- c("female","male","Total")
}

##-- Number of NGS samples collected per country

percCountry <- round(percCountry[1]/sum(percCountry)*100)

##-- Number of individuals detected per sex and per year

  numId_sexYear <- rbind(numId_sexYear,colSums(numId_sexYear))
  rownames(numId_sexYear) <- c("female","male","Total")
}
```

A total of `r numDet_sexYear["Total","Total"]` (`r numDet_sexYear["female","Total"]` female; `r numDet_sexYear["male","Total"]` male) genotyped `r species` genetic samples were included in the analysis, of which `r percCountry`% originated from Norway . These samples were associated with `r numId_sexYear["Total","Total"]` (`r numId_sexYear["female","Total"]` female; `r numId_sexYear["male","Total"]` male) individuals. We did not include individuals with unknown sex in this analysis.

```

## Density and abundance

We estimated that, within its primary range (`r round(detectors$n.detectors*(detectors$resolution/1000)^2)` $km^{2}$), the `r engSpecies` population was likely (95% credible interval) made up of between `r CI[1]` and `r CI[2]` individuals (95% credible interval) in `r years[length(years)]`, with between `r CI_F[1]` and `r CI_F[2]` females and between `r CI_M[1]` and `r CI_M[2]` males. Each year, a large proportion of the population is detected during annual large carnivore monitoring. Specifically, in `r years[length(years)]`, between XXX% and XXX% of the population were detected during non-invasive genetic sampling.

## Detection probability

The overall proportion of detected individuals in the study area was likely between 77% and 88% in 2023/2024 (Table A.11). The baseline detection probability for the structured and unstructured sampling varied both in time and space (Figure A.5 and Figure A.6). More specifically, the length of recorded search tracks positively affected detection probability of the structured sampling (2023/2024; males: Î²2Structured =0.17, CrI: 0.12 - 0.22; females: Î²2Structured = 0.28, CrI: 0.19 - 0.38; Table A.9). However, the previous detection of individuals and the average proportion of snow cover had no strong effect on detection probability for the structured sampling (Table A.9). Unstructured search effort derived using the observation data in Skandobs and Rovbase had a strong positive effect on detection probability during unstructured sampling (2023/2024; males: Î²4Unstructured = 1.35, CrI: 0.78 - 2.06; females: Î²4Unstructured = 1.67, CrI: 1.08 - 2.34; Table A.10). The effect of previous detection also tended to have a positive effect on detection probability during unstructured sampling, but the pattern was not consistent across years (Table A.10).
