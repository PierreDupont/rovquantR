# Introduction

Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) and dead recoveries are a centerpiece of national and regional large carnivore monitoring in Norway and Sweden. Accordingly, the Scandinavian `r species` (*`r latSpecies`*) population is monitored annually using non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) and recovery of dead individuals and both countries have collected an extensive individual-based data set publicly available and stored in the Scandinavian large carnivore database Rovbase ([rovbase.no](https://www.rovbase.no/), [rovbase.se](https://www.rovbase.se/)).

Since 2017, project [RovQuant](https://www.nmbu.no/en/projects/rovquant), from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU), has been developing statistical methods to exploit the potential of this database and allow a comprehensive assessment of the population status and dynamics of three large carnivore species, namely the brown bear (*Ursus arctos*), wolf (*Canis lupus*), and wolverine (*Gulo gulo*).

At the core of this analytical framework (@bischof2019rovquant, @bischof2020estimating) are Bayesian spatial capture-recapture (SCR) and open-population spatial capture-recapture (OPSCR) models (@ergon2014separating, @bischof2016, @chandler2018characterizing, @dupont2021deadreco). These models use the spatial and temporal information contained in the repeated genetic detections of individuals to estimate various population parameters, including spatially explicit abundance and vital rates. In addition, OPSCR models use the temporal information contained in data collected over multiple years to also estimate recruitment and survival probabilities, as well as inter-annual movements. Importantly, the approach accounts for imperfect detection during sampling (i.e., the fact that some individuals are not detected at all) and animal movement (i.e., the fact that individuals may use and be detected in multiple management units or countries). The OPSCR method brings along several advantages, including the ability to map density, derive jurisdiction-specific abundance, estimate survival and recruitment (which are needed for making population projections), and yield tractable measures of uncertainty (@bischof2019rovquant, @bischof2020estimating).

RovQuant reported abundance estimates for wolverines and wolves on an annual basis since 2019 [@bischof2019wolf; @bischof2019; @bischof2020estimating; @flagstad2021; @milleret2021wolf; @milleret2021wolverine; @milleret2022wolf; @milleret2022wolverine; @milleret2023wolf; @milleret2023wolverine; @milleret2024wolf] and for brown bears in Norway since 2022 [@dupontNorBear2021; @dupontNorBear2022; @dupontSweBear2023]. During these and other analyses [@milleret2018pab; @milleret2019local; @bischof2020consequences; @dupont2021deadreco; @turek2021efficient; @dey2022; @moqanaki2021], RovQuant has continuously improved the performance of the OPSCR models. In the present report we summarize the analysis of a `r length(years)`-year time-series (`r years[1]`- `r years[length(years)]`) of the latest available `r engSpecies` monitoring data and the most recent version of the OPSCR model. We provide the following information:

-   Annual and sex-specific estimates of the number of `r engSpecies` within the main population range (with credible intervals), as well as estimates by county and large carnivore management region.

-   Annual maps of `r engSpecies` density throughout the species’ primary range in Scandinavia.

-   Annual estimates of survival, cause-specific mortality, recruitment, and population growth rate (with credible intervals).

-   Estimated proportion of individuals detected through non-invasive genetic sampling (with credible intervals).

`r if(engSpecies == “bear”){ paste(“Although RovQuant aims to provide comprehensive analyses of large carnivore populations throughout their entire range in Norway and Sweden, we only analyzed and present results for the Norwegian monitoring data in this report. Previous analyses revealed multiple difficulties related to the Swedish brown bear non-invasive genetic monitoring data (Dupont et al., 2023a; Milleret et al., 2024a), leading among other things to inconsistent results across model permutations when the Scandinavian brown bear monitoring data were analyzed jointly for Norway and Sweden (Dupont et al., 2023b).”)}`

# Results

## Non-invasive genetic samples and dead recoveries

A total of 20 171 (8 828 female; 11 343 male) genotyped wolf genetic samples were included in the analysis, of which 76% originated from Sweden. These samples were associated with 1 838 (846 female; 992 male) individuals. We did not include individuals with unknown sex in this analysis. Among all genotyped samples, 8 803 (3660 female; 5143 male) were assigned to the structured sampling and 11 368 (5168 female; 6200 male) to the unstructured sampling. We also used 721 (324 female; 397 male) dead recoveries of wolves in the OPSCR model, of which 601 (267 female; 334 male) were due to legal culling and 120 (57 female; 63 male) due to other causes of mortality. The majority of dead recoveries (68%) originated from Sweden. Annual total and country-specific tallies of NGS samples and associated individuals, as well as dead recoveries included in the analysis are provided in the Appendices (NGS samples: Table A.2 and Table A.1, NGS individuals: Table A.3, dead recoveries: Table A.4)

## Density and abundance

Wolf abundance for the entire study area (322 400 km2, excluding the buffer area) was likely (95% credible interval) between 414 and 470 individuals in 2023/2024 (Table 1, Figure 1). Estimates refer to the status of the population at the start of the annual sampling period (Oct. 1). The proportion of females in the Scandinavian wolf population was likely between 48% and 54% in 2023/2024. Based on the model-predicted location of ACs, we estimated that in 2023/2024, between 353 to 403 individuals could be attributed to Sweden and 56 to 73 to Norway (Table 1). See Table 1 for total and sex-specific abundance estimates for each country and management area. See Table A.5 for annual wolf abundance estimates for all of Scandinavia and by region between 2014/2015 and 2023/2024. During the past three years, the wolf population experienced a steady decrease from 494-525 in 2021/2022 to 414-470 in 2023/2024 (Figure 2, Table A.5). Note that estimates for different years (Figure 2) shown here differ slightly from those provided in Bischof et al. (2020), Milleret et al. (2021), Milleret et al. (2022c), and Milleret et al. (2023). This is due to the use of an updated OPSCR model and the inclusion of additional years of data. The analysis yielded annual density maps, which illustrate changes in the distribution of wolves over time (Figure A.3).

Table 1: Wolf population size estimates in 2023/2024 within the study area by sex at several spatial scales: the entire study area, by country, by management unit (carnivore management regions in Norway and "Rovdjursförvaltningsområden" in Sweden), and counties (“Län” in Sweden); see also Figure A.2. Only counties and management units that are within or that intersect the study area are included in the table. Readers should focus on the 95% credible interval provided in parentheses, as these - unlike mean values - convey uncertainty inherent in abundance estimates. Numbers are based on estimated activity center locations of wolves. Combined female-male estimates were obtained by joining sex-specific posterior distributions. Rounding may result in small deviations between total estimates and the sum of the estimates for constituent regions. Note that the numbers reported here are predictions from a statistical model which always represents an oversimplification of reality and is based on available data (NGS and dead recoveries). As a consequence, especially at the local scale, the model-estimated number of wolves based on DNA sampling can deviate from the number of wolves inferred from ancillary observations (e.g., camera traps).

## Vital rates

The OPSCR model produced annual estimates of legal hunting mortality, mortality associated with all other causes, and per capita recruitment rates (Figure 3; Table A.7). There was temporal variation in mortality rates, with the risk of mortality from causes other than culling generally higher than the risk of mortality from culling. Overall, scent-marking adult individuals had a higher survival compared to other individuals, with no pronounced systematic difference between sexes (Figure A.4).

Figure 3: Mortality probabilities due to legal culling (light green) and all other causes (dark green) for female and male wolves. Darker and lighter bars show the 50% and 95% credible intervals, respectively. Shown are overall estimates throughout the study area. Estimates refer to deaths occurring between the start of one sampling season and the start of the next.

Figure 4: Estimated annual number of recruits for female and male wolves. Recruitment represents the number of new individuals present in the population on Oct 1 (i.e., individuals that were born between the two consecutive monitoring seasons and survived to Oct 1 or that immigrated in the study area). Darker and lighter bars show the 50% and 95% credible intervals, respectively.

## Detection probability

The overall proportion of detected individuals in the study area was likely between 77% and 88% in 2023/2024 (Table A.11). The baseline detection probability for the structured and unstructured sampling varied both in time and space (Figure A.5 and Figure A.6). More specifically, the length of recorded search tracks positively affected detection probability of the structured sampling (2023/2024; males: β2Structured =0.17, CrI: 0.12 - 0.22; females: β2Structured = 0.28, CrI: 0.19 - 0.38; Table A.9). However, the previous detection of individuals and the average proportion of snow cover had no strong effect on detection probability for the structured sampling (Table A.9). Unstructured search effort derived using the observation data in Skandobs and Rovbase had a strong positive effect on detection probability during unstructured sampling (2023/2024; males: β4Unstructured = 1.35, CrI: 0.78 - 2.06; females: β4Unstructured = 1.67, CrI: 1.08 - 2.34; Table A.10). The effect of previous detection also tended to have a positive effect on detection probability during unstructured sampling, but the pattern was not consistent across years (Table A.10).

# Suggestions for future improvements

RovQuant continues to work on improving the functionality and efficiency of OPSCR models. We recommend the following developments for future analyses of the Scandinavian wolf monitoring data:

1.  Review and adjust spatial covariates on density. This may involve the addition of land cover and topographic variables.

2.  Account for individual heterogeneity in detectability/space use, for example by using a finite-mixture approach [@cubaynes2010importance] .

3.  Consider alternative detection models that do not assume a half-normal shape and/or circular home ranges [@sutherland2015].

4.  Account for spatial variation in vital rates (i.e., survival, recruitment; @milleret2022estimating ).

# Population density

```

Within its primary range (`r detectors$n.detectors*(detectors$resolution/1000)^2` $km^{2}$), the `r engSpecies` population was likely (95% credible interval) made up of between `r CI[1]` and `r CI[2]` individuals in `r years[n.years]`, with an estimated `r CI_F[1]` to `r CI_F[2]` females and `r CI_M[1]` to `r CI_M[2]` males.
