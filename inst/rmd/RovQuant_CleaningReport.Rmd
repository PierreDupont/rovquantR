# Introduction

This document presents the data cleaning and checking process of the **`r SPECIES`** DNA data available from [RovBase 3.0](https://rovbase.no/), as done by the [AQEG team](https://www.nmbu.no/en/research/groups/applied-quantitative-ecology-group-aqeg) as part of the data preparation steps for SCR or OPSCR analyses of the large carnivore populations of Scandinavia. In this particular instance, we focus on the **`r engSpecies`** data collected during the period **`r years[1]`** to **`r years[length(years)]`**.

For the **`r SPECIES`**, we consider a sampling period each year that extends from **`r months[unlist(sampling.months)[1]]`** to **`r months[last(unlist(sampling.months))]`** (inclusive).

------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Rovbase data files

The first step consists in loading the most recent data for the focal species available from RovBase. This data was downloaded from [rovbase](https://rovbase30.miljodirektoratet.no/) on `r date` and is composed of two '.xlsx' spreadsheets containing:

- the species-specific **NGS** data, i.e. the compilation of all non-invasively collected DNA samples that were identified as coming from a `r engSpecies` after genetic analysis, the date and spatial coordinates where the DNA sample was collected, and the ID and sex of the individual it originated from (when available).

- the large carnivores' **dead recoveries** data, the compilation of all individuals recovered dead as part of the `r engSpecies` population management, hunts, or accidental deaths reported to managers.


The first steps of the cleaning process consist in :

-   translating Scandinavian characters

-   renaming columns to match the NGS and dead recovery files

-   merging both files into one

-   extracting year and month from POSIX dates

-   filtering out unusable samples



## Raw NGS data

The most recent file containing raw NGS data is:
```{r, raw NGS data, echo = F, collapse = TRUE}
##-- Get and print name of last NGS file
dirTest <- dir( path = data.dir,
                pattern = "DNA.xls",
                recursive = TRUE,
                ignore.case = TRUE,
                full.names = T)
index <- dirTest |>
  file.mtime() |>
  which.max() 
print(dirTest[index])

##-- NGS sample table
NGS_samples <- read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                                    paste0( engSpecies, "_Raw NGS Samples_",
                                            years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                            ".csv")),
                         row.names = 1,
                         check.names = FALSE)

##-- NGS id table data
NGS_ids <- read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                                paste0( engSpecies, "_Raw NGS Ids_",
                                        years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                        ".csv")),
                     row.names = 1,
                     check.names = FALSE)
```

This raw NGS data consists of :

-   `r NGS_samples["Total","Total"]` DNA samples collected between `r years[1]` and `r years[length(years)]` (`r NGS_samples["female","Total"]` female ; `r NGS_samples["male","Total"]` male).

```{r, raw NGS samples table, echo = F, collapse = TRUE}
knitr::kable( NGS_samples, 
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of NGS samples collected by year and sex") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

-   `r NGS_ids["Total","Total"]` individuals identified from those DNA samples (`r NGS_ids["female","Total"]` female ; `r NGS_ids["male","Total"]` male).

```{r, raw NGS ids table, echo = F, collapse = TRUE}
knitr::kable( NGS_ids,
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of individuals detected through NGS by year and sex") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```



## Raw dead recovery data

The most recent file containing raw dead recovery data is:
```{r, raw DR data, echo = F, collapse = TRUE}
##-- Get and print name of last NGS file
dirTest <- dir( path = data.dir,
                pattern = "dead",
                recursive = TRUE,
                ignore.case = TRUE,
                full.names = T)
index <- dirTest |>
  file.mtime() |>
  which.max() 
print(dirTest[index])

##-- Dead recoveries sample table
DR_samples <- read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                                   paste0( engSpecies, "_Raw DR Samples_",
                                           years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                           ".csv")),
                        row.names = 1,
                        check.names = FALSE)

##-- Dead Recoveries id table 
DR_ids <- read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                               paste0( engSpecies, "_Raw DR Ids_",
                                       years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                       ".csv")),
                    row.names = 1,
                    check.names = FALSE)
```

This dead recovery data consists of :

-   `r DR_samples["Total","Total"]` DNA samples collected between `r years[1]` and `r years[length(years)]` (`r DR_samples["female","Total"]` female ; `r DR_samples["male","Total"]` male).

```{r, raw DR samples table, echo = F, collapse = TRUE}
knitr::kable( DR_samples,
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of dead recoveries by year and sex") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

-   `r DR_ids["Total","Total"]` individuals identified from those DNA samples (`r DR_ids["female","Total"]` female ; `r DR_ids["male","Total"]` male).\

```{r, raw DR ids table data, echo = F, collapse = TRUE}
knitr::kable( DR_ids,
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of individuals identified from dead recoveries by year and sex") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

# Data cleaning & issues

```{r, clean data summary, echo = F, collapse = TRUE}
##-- Number of NGS samples
samples <-  read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                                 paste0( engSpecies, "_Clean NGS Samples_",
                                         years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                         ".csv")),
                      row.names = 1,
                      check.names = FALSE)

##-- Number of individuals detected alive
ids <-  read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                             paste0( engSpecies, "_Clean NGS Ids_",
                                     years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                     ".csv")),
                  row.names = 1,
                  check.names = FALSE)

##-- Number of DR samples
deadSamples <-  read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                                     paste0( engSpecies, "_Clean DR Samples_",
                                             years[1]," to ", years[length(years)], 
                                             ".csv")),  
                          row.names = 1,
                          check.names = FALSE)

##-- Number of individuals recovered
deadIds <-  read.csv( file.path( working.dir, "tables",
                                 paste0( engSpecies, "_Clean DR Ids_",
                                         years[1]," to ", years[length(years)], 
                                         ".csv")),
                      row.names = 1,
                      check.names = FALSE)
```


## Unuseable samples

After these initial checks several unusable samples were filtered out:

-   DNA samples without ID (N = `r info.ls$numNoID_DNA`)

-   DNA samples without spatial coordinates (N = `r info.ls$numNoCoords_DNA`)

-   DNA samples without dates (N = `r info.ls$numNoDate_DNA`)

-   dead recoveries without ID (N = `r info.ls$numNoID_DR`)

-   dead recoveries without spatial coordinates (N = `r info.ls$numNoCoords_DR`)

-   dead recoveries without dates (N = `r info.ls$numNoDate_DR`)

`r if(engSpecies == "wolverine"){paste0("-   removing ", length(info.ls$youngDeads) + length(info.ls$lowWeightDeads), " young wolverines recovered between March and November (Note that ", length(info.ls$zeroWeightDeads), " wolverines with weight = 0kg were kept in the data)")}`

`r if(engSpecies == "wolf"){paste0("-   overwriting sex assignment using info from Micke (N = ", info.ls$numOverwiteSex," individuals)")}`

`r if(engSpecies == "bear"){paste0("-   removing ", sum(!info.ls$remove.alive), " bear DNA samples and ", sum(!info.ls$remove.dead), " dead recoveries flagged by H.Brøseth")}`



## Issues

In addition, there were multiple flags raised during the data cleaning process.
These consist in e.g. individuals with multiple dead recoveries, individuals with multiple sex assignment, samples with contrasting information in the NGS and dead recovery files, etc... 



### Sex assignment
 
The numbers of individuals with problematic sex assigment, either because they were associated with multiple samples associated with different sexes after genotyping, or because the sex assignment procedure was not successful.

```{r, multiple sex, echo = F}
sexTab <- cbind.data.frame(
  "problems" = c("Unknown sex", "both 'female' and 'male'"),
  "number of individuals" = as.numeric(table(info.ls$doubleSexID)[c(1,3)]))

kable(sexTab, align = "lc") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```



### Dead recovery issues

-  `r info.ls$numDupId_DR` individuals had multiple dead recoveries in the dead recoveries Rovbase files.

`r if(!is.null(info.ls$dupId_DR)){info.ls$dupId_DR}`


- `r info.ls$numInDNA_notinDR` samples presumably associated with a dead recovery ('RovbaseID' starting with 'M') were registered in the NGS data file but not in the dead recovery file. 

`r if(!is.null(info.ls$inDNA_notinDR)){info.ls$inDNA_notinDR}`


- `r info.ls$numDupData` samples in the NGS data file were duplicated in the dead recovery file. `r if(info.ls$numDupData > 0) { paste0(" These samples were flagged and saved in '", file.path( working.dir, "tables", paste0( engSpecies, "_DR in DNA_", years[1]," to ", years[length(years)], ".csv'"))}`


- `r length(info.ls$samples.to.remove)` individuals were identified with NGS samples detected after their supposed death


------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Cleaned data

## Number of samples

After this clean-up, we are left with `r paste0(samples["Total","Total"],"(NOR = ",samples["(N)","Total"]," ; SWE = ",samples["(S)","Total"], ")")` NGS samples and `r paste0(deadSamples["Total","Total"], "(NOR = ",deadSamples["(N)","Total"]," ; SWE = ",deadSamples["(S)","Total"], ")")` dead recoveries.

```{r, clean data samples timeSeries, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = paste0("Figure 1: Numbers of ", engSpecies, " non-invasive genetic samples and dead recoveries per month between ", years[1], " and ", years[length(years)], ". Presented are the number of samples that were available in Rovbase and useable for the OPSCR analysis, i.e. with the individual ID, engSpecies, date and coordinates succesfully identified."), echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path( working.dir, "figures",
                                   paste0( engSpecies, "_Clean Rovbase Samples_",
                                           years[1]," to ", years[length(years)], ".png")))
```

```{r, clean data samples table, echo = F}
##-- Number of NGS samples
knitr::kable( samples,
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of useable NGS samples per year and country") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)

##-- Number of dead recoveries
knitr::kable( deadSamples,
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of useable DNA samples from dead animals per year and country") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```



## Number of individuals

In terms of individuals identified, these correspond to `r paste0(ids["Total","Total"], "(NOR = ",ids["(N)","Total"]," ; SWE = ",ids["(S)","Total"], ")")` individuals detected alive and `r paste0(deadIds["Total","Total"], "(NOR = ",deadIds["(N)","Total"]," ; SWE = ",deadIds["(S)","Total"], ")")` individuals recovered.

```{r, clean data ids timeSeries, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = paste0("Figure 2: Numbers of ", engSpecies, " individuals detected through non-invasive genetic samples and dead recoveries each year between ", years[1], " and ", years[length(years)], "."), echo = FALSE}
##-- Insert figure
knitr::include_graphics(file.path( working.dir, "figures",
                                   paste0( engSpecies, "_Clean Rovbase Ids_",
                                           years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                           ".png")))
```


```{r, clean data ids table, echo = F, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
##-- Number of IDs detected alive
knitr::kable( ids,
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of individuals detected through NGS per year and country") %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)

##-- Number of ID detected alive
knitr::kable( deadIds,
              align = "lc",
              caption = "Number of identified dead animals per year and country") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = F)
```



## Number of recaptures

```{r, NGS previously detected, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = paste0("Figure 3: A) Numbers of ", engSpecies, " individuals detected through non-invasive genetic sampling, and B) Numbers of ", engSpecies, " individuals recovered dead that were previously detected through NGS per year between ", years[1], " and ", years[length(years)], "."), echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path( working.dir, "figures",
                                   paste0( engSpecies, "_Previous Detection_",
                                           years[1]," to ", years[length(years)], 
                                           ".png")))
```



## Maps

We can also add maps of the NGS samples and dead recoveries collected each year:

```{r, NGS maps, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 8, fig.width = 12, fig.cap = paste0("Figure 4: Numbers of ", engSpecies, " individuals previously detected through non-invasive genetic sampling each year between ", years[1], " and ", years[length(years)], "."), echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path( working.dir, "figures",
                                   paste0( engSpecies,  "_Clean Rovbase Maps_",
                                           years[1]," to ", years[length(years)],
                                           ".png")))
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Save clean data

```{r, save data, echo = F}
fileName <- paste0("CleanData_", engSpecies, "_", date, ".RData")
```

Finally, we save the cleaned **alive** and **dead.recovery** sf objects as a .RData file with name **`r fileName`** located in the `r engSpecies`-specific folder (`r file.path(working.dir, "data")`).
